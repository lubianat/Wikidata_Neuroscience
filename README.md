# Wikidata-Neuroscience


The idea of the repository is to host code related to the [wikidata neuroscience project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Neuroscience).

**Which kind of code?**

For example, codes for automating queries and preparing quickstatements.
Also, lists of interesting items to be created and such. 

**What is quickstatements?** 

Check [the help page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements)

**Which language?** 

You are free to use any language you feel most confortable. 

There are python modules that can make Wikidata integration easier such as [WikidataIntegrator](https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator)

Other useful tools may include the [python wrapper for SPARQL services](https://github.com/RDFLib/sparqlwrapper) and [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) - [Wikidata's description](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/OpenRefine)

**To do tasks:**

Currently we have a broad set of [goals](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Neuroscience#Goals)

Any idea, contribution, or eventual problem, feel free to open issues and pull requests.
